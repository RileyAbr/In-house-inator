## In-house-inator Site

The `site` folder contains the project files for the documentation website for the bot. The wiki site is built as a **React** SPA with [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/). For styling, it uses [Chakra UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) as a base component library with a custom theme, plenty of custom styles, and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) to fill in gaps as needed.

### Features

-   Dynamically loads in command pages from Markdown files via a custom CMS-like architecture
    -   Thanks, [https://github.com/rexxars/react-markdown](https://github.com/rexxars/react-markdown)!

## Challenges & Hurdles üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1. The `In-house-inator` bot has to process a LOT of error states for the team seeding process. By allowing the bot to accept user input in the format that I did (simply providing inputs after the base command) it lead to a lot of edge cases to cover. I believe this makes it a more-robust project though as well as more user friendly!
2. After the `v1.0.0` release of the Discord bot, I decided to build the companion wiki site to supplement the `!in help` command. During this process, I rolled the two repositories into a single mono-repo. This proved to cause some headaches during the deploy process for both Netlify and Heroku. Netlify can be fixed simply enough via a native `netlify.toml` config file to specify a new source folder. For Heroku, I needed a more comprehensive solution. I went with a Git subtree for the `in-house-inator-bot` folder. For future reference, the command to push a subtree to heroku is:
    - `git subtree push --prefix {project_name} heroku {heroku_branch}`
    - NOTE: with the `v3.0.0` release the bot is no longer hosted on heroku.
3. Chakra UI is a FANTASTIC component and UI library and one I will definitely be recommending in the future. An oversight on my end is that Chakra UI components do not feature much support out-of-the-box üì¶ for animations. In order to make effects like my hand-waving invite button on the home page work, I had to spin up some styled-components in place and integrate them with the Chakra UI theme ecosystem. Overall, I think it worked great! Something to keep in mind for future projects though are options like [React Transition Group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/) or [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) would be more comprehensive solutions.
