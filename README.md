## In-house-inator Bot

The -bot folder contains all of the code used to run the Discord bot. The bot is built in **Node** using the [Discord.js library](https://discord.js.org/#/). The bot is hosted on a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) Dyno.

### Features

-   Builds in-house teams directly in Discord, no external service needed!
-   Can compose teams of scaling sizes with easy-to-input parameters
-   Discord embeds create clean message blocks to link to or pin for later
-   A cute lil' ray gun logo üî´

### Commands

All commands are called with `!in`

-   `!in team {# of teams} {# of players} {teamA, teamB, ...}`
    -   Shortcut: `!in`
    -   Creates teams from the members in the user's voice chat channel.
-   `!in help`
    -   The !in help command shows all of the commands available to the bot. It also provides a link to the wiki site for the In-house-inator.
-   `!in author`
    -   Provides author and metadata creation of the bot. Includes links to the author's website and social links--including Twitter and GitHub.
-   `!in version`
    -   Shows the bot's latest release.

## In-house-inator Site

The -site folder contains the project files for the documentation website for the bot. The wiki site is built as a **React** SPA with [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/). For styling, it uses [Chakra UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) as a base component library with a custom theme, plenty of custom styles, and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) to fill in gaps as needed.

### Features

-   Dynamically loads in command pages from Markdown files via a custom CMS-like architecture
    -   Thanks, [https://github.com/rexxars/react-markdown](https://github.com/rexxars/react-markdown)!
-   Built with modern React Hooks and ES6 Javascript
-   Full suite of tests using [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
-   Supports accessibility features and [A11y](https://www.a11yproject.com/) principles
-   Fully responsive design for all devices
-   Some animations here and there to spruce up the site üëã
-   A slick, mad scientist color scheme to charm any _-in-ator_ fanatic üî¨

## Challenges & Hurdles üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1. The `In-house-inator` bot has to process a LOT of error states for the team seeding process. By allowing the bot to accept user input in the format that I did (simply providing inputs after the base command) it lead to a lot of edge cases to cover. I believe this makes it a more-robust project though as well as more user friendly!
2. After the `v1.0.0` release of the Discord bot, I decided to build the companion wiki site to supplement the `!in help` command. During this process, I rolled the two repositories into a single mono-repo. This proved to cause some headaches during the deploy process for both Netlify and Heroku. Netlify can be fixed simply enough via a native `netlify.toml` config file to specify a new source folder. For Heroku, I needed a more comprehensive solution. I went with a Git subtree for the `in-house-inator-bot` folder. For future reference, the command to push a subtree to heroku is:
    - `git subtree push --prefix {project_name} heroku {heroku_branch}`
3. Chakra UI is a FANTASTIC component and UI library and one I will definitely be recommending in the future. An oversight on my end is that Chakra UI components do not feature much support out-of-the-box üì¶ for animations. In order to make effects like my hand-waving invite button on the home page work, I had to spin up some styled-components in place and integrate them with the Chakra UI theme ecosystem. Overall, I think it worked great! Something to keep in mind for future projects though are options like [React Transition Group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/) or [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) would be more comprehensive solutions.
